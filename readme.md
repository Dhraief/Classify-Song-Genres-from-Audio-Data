# Project Description

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), I  train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). I will first make use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors.

Next, I  use the scikit-learn package to predict whether you can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc.
